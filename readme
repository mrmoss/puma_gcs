Installing the server:
	To run the server start it up from the command line like so:
	Windows:	gcs.exe
	Linux/Mac:	./gcs

	Specify which port to run the web server on in the command line like so:
	Windows:	gcs.exe 8080
	Linux/Mac:	./gcs 8080

	This is meant to be run on a server for multiple clients can connect to it.
	It would be better to add this program to the startup applications.
	Windows:	Add to startup folder.
	Linux:		Add to /etc/rc.local file.
	Mac:		ERR...ADD LATER...

To compile the server from source:
	Windows:	Run make.bat.
	Linux/Mac:	Run make.
